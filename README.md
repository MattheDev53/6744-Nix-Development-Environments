# 6744-Nix-Development-Environments

Development environments for Devs on Mehlville RC. Very WIP, probably a long shot, but it could be worth it. If you are an FRC Team, feel free to fork and add changes.

> [!WARNING]
> For teams using the WPILib VSCode Extension, it is not in Nixpkgs. I have [an issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/393313) open. I have given up on trying to package it, as it is far beyond my knowledge
