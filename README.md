# 6744-Nix-Development-Environments

Development environments for Devs on Mehlville RC. Very WIP, probably a long shot, but it could be worth it. If you are an FRC Team, feel free to fork and add changes.

> [!WARNING]
> For teams using the WPILib VSCode Extension, it is not in Nixpkgs. I have [an issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/393313) open. I also have [an issue](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/issues/7897) open on WPILib's main page asking about packaging stuff for Nix. I have given up on trying to package the VSCode Extension, as it is far beyond my knowledge, but I am (kinda) trying to package pathplanner because it seems easier.
